![Dashboard Preview](https://github.com/RichardParado/personal_website/blob/main/assets/images/Personal%20Finance%20Dashboard%20-%20Thumbnail.png)

## Overview

This repository contains a Personal Finance Dashboard created using Microsoft Power BI. The dashboard allows users to track their income, expenses, and savings visually, enabling them to gain better insights into their financial situation. Additionally, the dashboard incorporates a budgeting feature based on the popular 50-30-20 principle, which helps users allocate their income wisely.

## Features

1. **Income Tracking**: Users can enter their income data, and the dashboard will visualize the income over time, making it easy to monitor changes and identify trends.

2. **Expense Tracking**: Users can enter their expenses into a Google Sheets document, which serves as the data source. Power BI connects to this Google Sheets document and presents the expense data in various interactive charts and graphs. Users can analyze their spending habits, categorize expenses, and make data-driven decisions.

3. **Savings Monitoring**: The dashboard includes a savings tracker that shows users how much they have saved over time. This visual representation encourages users to stay on track with their savings goals.

4. **Budgeting with 50-30-20 Principle**: The dashboard incorporates the 50-30-20 budgeting rule, which suggests allocating 50% of income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. The dashboard compares actual spending to the budgeted amounts and provides insights into adherence to the principle.
